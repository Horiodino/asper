# asper
Hii i thinked about this in mid of 2023 but never tried to worked on it , there are many cloud these days .
but what i came up with is that why cant you make your own cloud, i thought people who want to make there own cloud 
they can but its not managed , so what i cmae up is that kvm , we are here to create a self managed cloud structure that can be deployed 
on servers and it will be fully managed like plug and play devices! , then you just need to expose it tp the internet and your cloud is ready
anyone can use it , create vm and k8s services!.
Thats the idea behind this so called Asper.
